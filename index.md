## Latest on `Tristan-MP v2`

`Tristan-MP v2` is the second (arguably third) reincarnation of the most awesome astroplasma particle-in-cell code in the world written in Fortran 90.

If you would like to learn more about the code structure, compilation rules, or how to build a user file, feel free to read through this wiki.
